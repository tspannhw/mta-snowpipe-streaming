Based on the coordinates **40.583957672, -74.16104126**, the location is on Staten Island, New York, in the parking area adjacent to the **Staten Island Mall** — specifically the **Park & Ride** area.

Here's a description:

- **General Area:** This spot is just off Richmond Avenue in the neighborhood of New Springville, Staten Island.
- **Facility:** The **Staten Island Mall Park & Ride** is a designated commuter parking lot next to the Staten Island Mall, used for express buses to Manhattan and some local bus connections.
- **Surroundings:**  
  - The mall itself is directly east, with a large complex of retail stores and restaurants.  
  - The Park & Ride area is an asphalt parking lot with marked bus bays and shelters for passengers.  
  - To the west is Marsh Avenue and to the north/south are mall access roads and more parking areas.  
- **Purpose:** Commuters park their cars here and board MTA express buses like SIM-series lines to reach Manhattan, reducing traffic congestion.

If you’d like, I can also give you **a visual orientation** (imagining street view) of where the bus stops within the lot and which side the mall is on. Would you like me to do that?"
